 shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the starrrrt
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts
So many questions
When this began we was the perfect match
Perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it
And now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin
Out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand
If you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment
In other arms i wanna shelter you from harm
