 shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the starrrrt
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts
So many questions
When this began we was the perfect match
Perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it
And now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin
Out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand
If you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment
In other arms i wanna shelter you from harm
Happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills
Out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble
But I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed
No need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do
